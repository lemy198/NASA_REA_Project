### Main Objectives
* Develop a deep learning-based model to predict aerosol sensor reading.

### Sample Code 
* The sample code is updated to the Github. You can access it at [location](./Code/Sample%20Code/24_aerosol.ipynb).
* To run this sample code, you need to download it and place it inside the folder where you store the training and testing data. 
* The sample code is in ``ipynb`` format. You can use Jupyter Notebook to run this code. 
  * How to use Jupyter Notebook?
